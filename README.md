# graph-toolkit
A repository to implement blueprintjs and react-force-graph to create a great toolkit for graph exploration. We might implement cugraph in a later stadium for big-data visualisations.

# local development
I used node v18.0. and ran the following commands: 
- npm install yarn -g
- npm install vite -g
- yarn install
- yarn install --dev

# own data
Dont forget to add your own dataset in the folder public/datasets containing a dict with dates and per date nodes/links set suitable for react-force-graph. The name of the file should be dataset.json
